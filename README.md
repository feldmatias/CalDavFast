### What is CalDav? (By ChatGPT)

CalDav is a protocol designed to allow users to access and manage calendar data on a remote server. It is an extension of the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) protocol, which allows for the creation and modification of web-based resources, including calendars.

CalDav enables users to retrieve calendar data, schedule meetings, and set reminders from their personal calendars on different devices, such as smartphones, laptops, or tablets. It uses the iCalendar format, a standard for exchanging calendar and scheduling information, to represent calendar data.

CalDav is supported by various calendar applications, including Apple iCal, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Microsoft Outlook, as well as open-source software, such as DAViCal and Baikal. It is also compatible with Google Calendar, which allows users to synchronize their Google calendar with third-party CalDav clients.

Overall, CalDav simplifies the process of accessing and sharing calendar data across multiple devices and applications.

### Why Rust? (By ChatGPT)

Rust is a programming language that has gained popularity in recent years due to its focus on performance, safety, and reliability. These characteristics make it well-suited for developing network applications, such as CalDav servers.

First, Rust's memory safety features, such as its ownership and borrowing system, prevent common memory-related errors such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows, which are common sources of security vulnerabilities. This makes Rust a good choice for developing secure network applications like CalDav servers.

Second, Rust's concurrency model and lightweight threading support allow for efficient handling of multiple client connections, making it well-suited for developing scalable network applications.

Third, Rust has a low-level control over system resources, allowing for fine-grained optimization of performance. This is especially important for network applications that need to handle large amounts of data and high levels of concurrency.

Finally, Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, including the hyper HTTP library, which provides a high-performance foundation for developing web applications like CalDav servers.

Overall, Rust's performance, safety, and reliability features make it an attractive choice for developing high-performance network applications like CalDav servers.


# Development
- Install Rust https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
- Install pre-commit hook:
  1. `pip install pre-commit`
  2. `pre-commit install`
- Run `cargo run` to start the server
